# dipole-magnetic-field-simulator
Plots and simulates a vector field of multiple dipoles of unique locations. 

Project: Magnetic dipole simulation.

Simulate the field around a magnetic dipole according to the below link to formula. https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0991963d60a114ec41900b0eec04c944d03bb603

Notes: mu_0 is the vacuum permeability and is defined as: mu_0 = 4 * pi E -7 H/m Henry per meter is the SI unit for magnetic field flux. Thus, the constant term in the formula is 1E-7 H/m.
